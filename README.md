# firstQuarterProject
the name of the folder says it all! 

This is a simple web app for my first quarter project. 
It pulls from lastFM and Spotify APIs to play 30 second clips of searched artists. 
In addition, it lists the bands you've searched for in a side bar, as well as lists
their 'child artists' below them, thus leaving a search history, showing the path of
how you got to an artist.
